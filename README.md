## Project Goals

`In this project, you’ll be building your own club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!`

​**_In this project, you’ll build a webpage for a local club. You can base it on real-life organization you belong to or make one up! You’ll get to choose everything about your page: the club name, the page layout and styling, any images that you want to use, and more!_**​

Possible responsive design concepts to demonstrate:​

1. **Making images toggle to certain percentages in terms of `width` after a certain minimum screen size.**
2. **Using a `@media` rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.**
3. **Employing responsive units `em` and `rem` to size and space elements with `width` and `padding`.**
